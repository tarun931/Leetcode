/*
    logic : ceil((double)it.second / (it.first+1)) * (it.first+1)

    Divide the number of rabbits that gave answer x (i.e., it.second) by x + 1 â€” this gives us how many full groups we can form.

But since we can't leave a group partially formed (e.g., if 5 rabbits say 2, but 3 rabbits fit in a group, we need 2 groups), we take the ceiling.

Then, multiply by x + 1 to get the total rabbits accounted for (some might be theoretical rabbits not present in the array but implied by the answer).
